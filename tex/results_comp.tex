\section{Comparisons}
In order to compare the two pareto fronts in the results above, each design was exposed to an identical load consisting of a 147 kN force acting vertically along the y axis. The peak stress was obtained and tabulated. 

\subsection{Comparison of Long Run Results}
Figure \ref{fig:pfront_comp_long} shows a plot of this compairson between the two Long-Run fronts. Note that the solver for the aggregate LHS appears to cover a wider portion of the solution space, but that both graphs follow roughly the same curve.

\subsection{Comparison of Short Run Results}
Figure \ref{fig:pfront_comp_short} shows a plot of this compairson between the two Short-Run fronts. Note that despite the same solution times, the Stocastic Loads plot has resulted in designs returning higher stress values in some weight ranges.
