\section{Optimization}
Optimization is defined as ``a mathematical technique for finding a maximum or minimum value of a function of several variables subject to a set of constraints."\cite{opt-def} In the specific case of engineering design, one of several techniques is used to minimize an objective function, such as stress or weight. All of these techniques begin by randomly varying the independent variables of the function and making decisions based on the changes to the dependent variable.

\subsection{Differential Evolution}
Differential evolution was selected as the optimizer for this study. Differential optimization works...\todo{Use textbook to describe and define DE optimization}

\subsection{Extending DE to Multi-Objective}
Differential Evolution Optimization is originally a single-objective method. However, it can easily be extended to multi-objective operation by changing the method by which fitness is evaluated. Instead of a single fitness function, multiple independent fitness functions are evaluated using the concept of Pareto dominance. 

\subsection{Pareto Dominance}
Pareto Dominance is a simple way to compare systems based on multiple different fitness criteria. Pareto dominance for a minimization problem can be described by the following formula: 

Let the vector of fitness values for two arbitrary solutions be defined as:
\begin{align*}
C_a &= 4
\end{align*}

$$
P_{a,b} = \begin{cases}
          \hbox{True  when  } C_{a}^i < C_{b}^i \; \forall i \in \{1..n\}\\ 
          \hbox{False otherwise}
          \end{cases}
$$
