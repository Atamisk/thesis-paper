The results for sample runs of each solution strategy are printed below. Each method was run twice. One set of solutions were designed to solve in approximately 2.5 hours on the reference hardware. The other run was targeted at approximately an hour. Each Pareto optimal design is summarized and the design parameters given in tabular form. Also given are the solution statistics for each run, which include resource usage and wall clock time taken to arrive at a solution. After each set of results is given, the design parameters found by each strategy is compared, as well as the solution statistics.
