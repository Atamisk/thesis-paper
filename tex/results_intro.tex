The results for a sample run of each solution strategy are printed below. Each pareto optimal design is summarized and the design parameters given in tabular form. Also given are the solution statistics for each run, which include resource usage and wall clock time taken to arrive at a solution. After each set of results is given, the design parameters found by each strategy is compared, as well as the solution statistics.
