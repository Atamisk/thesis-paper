First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge Dr. Gene Hou for his guidance and camaraderie throughout developing this document. His wisdom and passion for engineering pushed me to develop this study to a point that would not have otherwise been possible. 

I would also like to thank my coworkers at Newport News Shipbuilding for all of their help and guidance whenever I've had a question or needed help thinking something through. I would like to specifically thank Dr. Billy Wagner for inspiring me by sharing his passion for finite element analysis and starting me down the path to this paper. 

Finally, I would like to thank NASA for choosing to open-source the 1995 edition of NASTRAN, which wound up being a major factor in the success of this project. I would also like to acknowledge Mr. Luca Dall'Olio for his efforts to make the NASTRAN source code build-able on a modern PC.
