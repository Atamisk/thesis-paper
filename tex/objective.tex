\section{Objective}
This study will seek to develop a method to design an equalizer beam using multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, the study will seek to incorporate treatment of uncertain input loads in the solution method. The development of the solution will focusing on the optimizer design, using relatively simple methods of varying design parameters.
