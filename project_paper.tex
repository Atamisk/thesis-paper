\section{Performance requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lifting capacity: 15 metric tons, 15000kg, 33000 lbm, 147 kN
\end{enumerate}
\section{Validation Load}
The selected validation load was chosen based on the targeted lifting capacity of the beam, which is 147 kN. This is the validation load that was chosen. 
\section{Validation Criteria}
The validation stress was chosen such that the overall system safety factor is in accordance with ASME BTH-1, for a Design Category B lifting beam. This dictates a factor of safety for the beam to be no more than 33\% of the minimum yield stress of the material. In this case, we are assuming the use of ASTM A-572 Grade 42 Steel with a yield point of 289 MPa. 
In this case, this equates to:
\begin{align*}
	\sigma_{\mathit{allow}} &= 0.33 \cdot S_{y}\\
	\sigma_{allow} &= 0.33 \cdot 289  \text{ MPa} \\
	\sigma_{allow} &= 95.3 \text{ MPa}
\end{align*}
